Clinic Inventory Statistical Audit (Daily Control Process)

Overview

This repository documents a simple, practical inventory audit process designed for a busy clinic environment.
The goal is to catch small stock and billing errors early—before they grow into month-end discrepancies—without burdening staff or disrupting patient care.

The entire daily process takes 20–30 minutes and focuses only on high-impact medicines, rather than attempting full daily reconciliation (which is unrealistic in a high-volume clinic).

Why This Approach

Clinics are fast-paced; staff constantly switch between patients and paperwork

Full daily reconciliation consumes too much time and is often skipped

Small daily errors compound into major monthly issues

This process prioritizes:

Consistency

Low effort

Early detection

Staff-friendly corrections

Step 1: Selecting High-Risk Medicines

Instead of tracking all medicines, I focus only on those most likely to cause errors.
Selection criteria:

Used very frequently (small errors add up quickly)

Similar or shortened names (easy to mix up)

Prescribed regularly (billing discipline matters most here)

Current Watch List

Dolo 650 – Often written differently (“Dolo”, “Dolo kind”, etc.)

Azithromycin 500 – Frequently shortened to “Azithro”

Pantoprazole 40 – High-volume medicine; even small slips matter

This list remains stable unless usage patterns change.

Step 2: Daily Medicine Name Check (≈10 minutes)

Every morning, I review the previous day’s sales for only the watch-list medicines.

What I Check

Actual medicine names entered on bills

Variations or abbreviations used

Actions Taken

New variation found (e.g., “Dolo fast”):
→ Added to the mapping list and linked to the correct medicine name

Repeated old mistake (e.g., “Azithro”):
→ Quiet, one-on-one reminder to the staff member

No public corrections or escalation—just quick fixes and gentle reinforcement.

Step 3: Quick Stock Math Check (≈5–7 minutes)

For each watch-list medicine, I apply this formula:

Opening Stock + New Stock – Total Sold = Expected Closing Stock


I then physically glance at the shelf to compare.

Tolerance Rule

Within ±2% → No action

Beyond ±2% → Review sales entries the same day

This prevents overreacting to minor handling differences while still catching real issues early.

Step 4: Random Bill Audit (≈5–10 minutes)

Each day, I randomly select 3–5 bills that include watch-list medicines.

What I Verify

Correct medicine name used

Quantity matches prescription and logic

Because staff don’t know which bills will be checked, accuracy improves across all billing, not just the reviewed ones.

Step 5: Weekly Review (15 minutes, once a week)

Throughout the week, I maintain a simple issue log.

Sample Log Format
Date	Medicine	Issue Observed	Repeated?
Aug 1	Dolo 650	Written as “Dolo”	Yes
Aug 3	Azithromycin 500	Quantity mismatch	No
Weekly Insights

Same error 3 times → Conduct mini-training

Errors scattered → Review or adjust the process itself

This converts daily observations into actionable improvements.

Step 6: When to Escalate to the Doctor

Most issues are handled independently to avoid unnecessary interruptions.

Doctor Is Informed Only If:

There is actual financial loss

The same error persists despite corrections

A stock issue could impact patient care

Otherwise, the doctor remains focused on clinical work.
