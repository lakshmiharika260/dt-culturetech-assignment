# Task 1: Clinic Inventory Statistical Audit

## How I Thought About This
When I set this up, I pictured exactly how our clinic works—always busy, with staff switching between patients and paperwork.

I knew we didn’t need something complicated. We needed a **simple, repeatable habit** that stops small mistakes before they turn into big problems at the end of the month.

So I built this daily check to take **only 20–30 minutes** and focus only on **what really matters**.

I intentionally avoided full daily reconciliation because the staff time it would consume is not worth the benefit, and the process would eventually be skipped in a busy clinic.

## Step 1: How I Pick Which Medicines to Watch
I started by asking: **Which medicines cause the most confusion or errors?**

I don’t check everything—just the ones that are:
- Used the most every day (because a tiny mistake adds up fast)
- Have names that sound alike (easy to mix up when you’re rushed)
- Prescribed all the time (so we build good billing habits here)

### Current Shortlist
- **Dolo 650** – Everyone writes it differently: “Dolo,” “Dolo kind,” etc.
- **Azithromycin 500** – Often shortened to “Azithro” on bills
- **Pantoprazole 40** – Given so often, any slip-up here matters

I stick to these unless something changes.

## Step 2: My Daily Name Check (≈10 minutes)
Every morning, I pull up **yesterday’s sales** and look only at those high-risk medicines.  
I scan for what names were actually written on the bills.

### When I Spot a Variation
- **If it’s new** (e.g., “Dolo fast”)  
  → I add it to my mapping list so it points to **“Dolo 650”**
- **If it’s an old mistake again** (e.g., “Azithro”)  
  → I remind the staff member quietly to use the full name

I don’t make a big deal out of it—just a quick fix and a gentle reminder.

---

## Step 3: My Quick Math Check (≈5–7 minutes)
For each medicine on my list, I do this simple math:

Opening Stock + New Stock – Total Sold = What Should Be Left

Then I glance at the shelf to see what’s actually there.

### My Tolerance Rule
- **Within 2%** → No action  
- **Outside 2%** → Check sales slips the same day  

---

## Step 4: My Random Bill Checks (≈5–10 minutes)
Each day, I pick **3–5 bills at random** that include my watch-list medicines.

### What I Check
- Was the correct medicine name used?
- Does the quantity make sense?

Nobody knows which bills I’ll pick—so everyone stays careful on **every bill**.

---

## Step 5: My Weekly Review (≈15 minutes, once a week)
I keep a simple log throughout the week.  
Every Friday, I review it.

### Sample Log

| Date  | Medicine           | What Happened        | Repeated? |
|------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Aug 1 | Dolo 650           | Written as “Dolo”   | Yes       |
| Aug 3 | Azithromycin 500   | Qty didn’t match    | No        |

### How I Use This
- If the same error happens **3 times** → I do a mini-training
- If errors are scattered → The process itself may need a tweak

---

## Step 6: My Rule for When to Tell the Doctor
I handle almost everything myself.

I only involve the doctor if:
- There’s **real money missing**
- The same mistake keeps happening after correction
- A stock issue could **affect a patient**

Otherwise, the doctor doesn’t need to know—they can stay focused on patient care.
